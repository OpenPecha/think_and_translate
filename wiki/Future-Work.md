# Future Work

## Short Term

- [ ] **More DPO iterations** (3-5 total) to close performance gap
- [ ] **Longer reasoning** for complex philosophical passages
- [ ] **Fix repetition issues** in reasoning generation

## Medium Term

- [ ] **Online DPO**: Use Claude as real-time reward model
- [ ] **Dedicated Reward Model**: Train BERT/Llama specifically for Buddhist translation quality
- [ ] **Technical term enforcement**: Penalize incorrect terminology

## Long Term

- [ ] **Reasoning Agents**: Pause during thinking to:
  - Search dictionaries (84000, Wedemeyer)
  - Query vector database for similar translations
  - Consult commentaries
- [ ] **Human-in-the-loop RLHF**: Expert translator feedback
- [ ] **Multimodal**: Translate from woodblock print images

## Goal

Create the most accurate and interpretable Tibetan translation system—providing not just translations, but reasoned explanations of linguistic choices.
